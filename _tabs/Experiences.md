  - The unpredictability of message delays in the synchronization process greatly influence the performance of time synchronization in wireless sensor networks.
  - We propose a joint design of delay compensation and one-way synchronization, which achieves estimation of clock parameters and fluctuated message delays at the same time.
  - We design a one-way broadcast scheme which update clock parameters with only one-way message based on the Kalman filter.
  - With the accurate delay estimation, we derive an improved clock offset estimation algorithm.
  - The proposed algorithm is performed on MATLAB simulation and experimental testbed with five nRF52832 Bluetooth nodes.

  - A PCIe data acquisition board is designed to verify the hardware and algorithm of 8 ADC time interleaved sampling based on Virtex-7 FPGA.
  - 8 ADCs with a sampling rate greater than 50MSPS and a quantization accuracy of 14bits is adopted. 
  - The delay of the sampling time in ADC is controlled by clock registers to realize interleaved sampling.  
  - The sampling data is transmitted to FPGA internal calibration algorithm with JESD204B protocol and is transferred to the hard disk for storage through the PCIE interface.
  - SPI configuration, BRAM control and cross clock domains processing are also involved.
  - A upper computer software is realized to perform subsequent data processing and graph display.

  - When persons are occluded by various obstacles, the noise caused by the occluded area greatly affects the pedestrian retrieval results.
  - We propose a semantic-guided alignment model that uses image semantic information to separate useful information from occlusion noise.
  - We fuse the probability maps with the global features of the image, and derive an automatic cropping method to guide the model to focus on public visible human regions and local features.
  - We propose a measurement strategy that only calculates the distance of public areas between images, thereby suppressing the spatial misalignment.
  - Experimental results confirm that our method achieves top performance in the holistic pedestrian re-identification problem.


### Summer intern in Wechat development

Location: Tencent, Guangzhou, Guangdong Provence, China

  - The current system embeddes verify process within the program, which makes a large number of repeated work and is to difficult to upgrade uniformly. 
  - We integrated various protocol interface outside and form an unified authentication platform.
  - This platform provides disaster recovery processing capabilities and expansion to various authentication methods, such as gragh captcha, QQ login, SMS service, facial recognition and paycard verification.
  - Though program, I have have a deeper understanding of C++ and Linux programming, internet communication and networking.
